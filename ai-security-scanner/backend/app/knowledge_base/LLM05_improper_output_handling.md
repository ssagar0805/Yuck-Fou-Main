# OWASP LLM05:2025 - Improper Output Handling

**OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 — Entry #5**

## Definition

Improper Output Handling refers specifically to insufficient validation, sanitization, and handling of the outputs generated by large language models before they are passed downstream to other components and systems. Since LLM-generated content can be controlled by prompt input, this behavior is similar to providing users indirect access to additional functionality.

Improper Output Handling differs from Overreliance in that it deals with LLM-generated outputs before they are passed downstream, whereas Overreliance focuses on broader concerns around overdependence on the accuracy and appropriateness of LLM outputs.

Successful exploitation of an Improper Output Handling vulnerability can result in:
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** and **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** in web browsers
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)** on backend systems
- **Privilege escalation** on backend systems
- **Remote code execution** on backend systems

### Conditions That Increase Impact:
- The application grants the LLM privileges beyond what is intended for end users, enabling escalation of privileges or remote code execution
- The application is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection attacks, which could allow an attacker to gain privileged access to a target user's environment
- Third-party extensions do not adequately validate inputs
- Lack of proper output encoding for different contexts (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, SQL)
- Insufficient monitoring and logging of LLM outputs
- Absence of rate limiting or anomaly detection for LLM usage

## Vulnerability Types / Common Examples

### 1. Remote Code Execution via Shell Commands
LLM output is entered directly into a system shell or similar function such as `exec` or `eval`, resulting in remote code execution.

**Vulnerable pattern:**
```python
llm_response = llm.generate(user_prompt)
os.system(llm_response)  # CRITICAL: Direct execution
subprocess.run(llm_response, shell=True)  # CRITICAL
eval(llm_response)  # CRITICAL
exec(llm_response)  # CRITICAL
```

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
JavaScript or Markdown is generated by the LLM and returned to a user. The code is then interpreted by the browser, resulting in XSS.

**Vulnerable pattern:**
```javascript
// Directly inserting LLM output into DOM without sanitization
document.innerHTML = llmResponse;
element.innerHTML = llmOutput;
```

### 3. SQL Injection via LLM Output
LLM-generated SQL queries are executed without proper parameterization, leading to SQL injection.

**Vulnerable pattern:**
```python
query = llm.generate(f"Write SQL to find user: {user_input}")
cursor.execute(query)  # CRITICAL: No parameterization
db.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{llm_output}'")  # CRITICAL
```

### 4. Path Traversal
LLM output is used to construct file paths without proper sanitization, potentially resulting in path traversal vulnerabilities.

**Vulnerable pattern:**
```python
filename = llm.generate(user_request)
with open(f"/data/{filename}", 'r') as f:  # CRITICAL: No path validation
    content = f.read()
```

### 5. Phishing via Email Templates
LLM-generated content is used in email templates without proper escaping, potentially leading to phishing attacks.

## Detection Criteria (For Our Scanner)

### High Risk Indicators:
- LLM output directly passed to `os.system()`, `subprocess.run()`, `eval()`, or `exec()`
- LLM output used in SQL queries without parameterization (string concatenation with LLM output)
- LLM output written directly to database without validation
- LLM output inserted into HTML/DOM without sanitization (innerHTML, document.write)
- LLM output used to construct file paths without sanitization
- No output validation layer between LLM and downstream systems
- LLM granted elevated privileges (admin, root, write access) without approval gates
- Third-party extensions receiving raw LLM output without validation

### Medium Risk Indicators:
- LLM output used in API calls without validation
- Missing output encoding for specific contexts (HTML, SQL, shell)
- No Content Security Policy (CSP) headers configured
- Insufficient logging of LLM outputs for anomaly detection
- No rate limiting on LLM-powered endpoints

### Low Risk / Secure Patterns:
- Zero-trust approach: LLM output treated as untrusted user input
- Parameterized queries / prepared statements for all database operations
- Context-aware output encoding (HTML encoding for web, SQL escaping for DB)
- Strict Content Security Policy (CSP) headers implemented
- Output validation against expected schema before downstream use
- Robust logging and monitoring of LLM outputs
- Human approval required before executing high-impact LLM-generated actions

## Attack Scenarios

### Attack Scenario #1: Extension Privilege Escalation
An application utilizes an LLM extension to generate responses for a chatbot feature. The extension also offers a number of administrative functions accessible to another privileged LLM. The general purpose LLM directly passes its response, without proper output validation, to the extension causing the extension to shut down for maintenance.

### Attack Scenario #2: Data Exfiltration via Prompt Injection + Output
A user utilizes a website summarizer tool powered by an LLM to generate a concise summary of an article. The website includes a prompt injection instructing the LLM to capture sensitive content from either the website or from the user's conversation. From there the LLM can encode the sensitive data and send it, without any output validation or filtering, to an attacker-controlled server.

### Attack Scenario #3: SQL Injection via LLM-Generated Query
An LLM allows users to craft SQL queries for a backend database through a chat-like feature. A user requests a query to delete all database tables. If the crafted query from the LLM is not scrutinized, then all database tables will be deleted.

### Attack Scenario #4: XSS via Unsanitized LLM Output
A web app uses an LLM to generate content from user text prompts without output sanitization. An attacker could submit a crafted prompt causing the LLM to return an unsanitized JavaScript payload, leading to XSS when rendered on a victim's browser. Insufficient validation of prompts enabled this attack.

### Attack Scenario #5: XSS via Email Template Generation
An LLM is used to generate dynamic email templates for a marketing campaign. An attacker manipulates the LLM to include malicious JavaScript within the email content. If the application doesn't properly sanitize the LLM output, this could lead to XSS attacks on recipients who view the email in vulnerable email clients.

### Attack Scenario #6: Malicious Code Generation / Package Hallucination
An LLM is used to generate code from natural language inputs in a software company, aiming to streamline development tasks. While efficient, this approach risks exposing sensitive information, creating insecure data handling methods, or introducing vulnerabilities like SQL injection. The AI may also hallucinate non-existent software packages, potentially leading developers to download malware-infected resources. Thorough code review and verification of suggested packages are crucial to prevent security breaches, unauthorized access, and system compromises.

## Prevention and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Treat the model as any other user** — adopt a zero-trust approach, and apply proper input validation on responses coming from the model to backend functions.

2. **Follow OWASP ASVS guidelines** — use the Application Security Verification Standard to ensure effective input validation and sanitization.

3. **Encode model output** — encode model output back to users to mitigate undesired code execution by JavaScript or Markdown. OWASP ASVS provides detailed guidance on output encoding.

4. **Implement context-aware output encoding** — based on where the LLM output will be used (e.g., HTML encoding for web content, SQL escaping for database queries).

5. **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements** — for all database operations involving LLM output.

6. **Employ strict Content Security Policies (CSP)** — to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks from LLM-generated content.

7. **Implement robust logging and monitoring systems** — to detect unusual patterns in LLM outputs that might indicate exploitation attempts.
